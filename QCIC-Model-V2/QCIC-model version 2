This project includes the source codes for the quantitative cancer-immunity cycle (QCIC) model. 
The QCIC model employs differential equations to capture the biological mechanisms underlying the cancer-immunity cycle and 
predicts tumor evolution dynamics under various treatment strategies through stochastic computational methods. 
A detailed description of the model should be referred to the following paper:

Chenghang Li, Yongchang Wei, Jinzhi Lei, Quantitative cancer-immunity cycle modeling for predicting disease progression in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. 

The project file includes:

（1）The document “QCIC model operation document.PDF” contains an explanation of the usage of the codes and the protocol for running the 
program and plotting the figures. 

（2）The folder "QCIC model basic operation code" includes MALTAB codes for model definition, virtual patient generation, 
and simulation of the cancer-immunity cycle dynamics. This folder includes key codes for model simulation. 

（3）The folders “Fig.2 ~ Fig.S10” include programs used for data processing and plotting for each of the Figures in the paper.
